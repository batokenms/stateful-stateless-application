# stateful-stateless-application

In a stateful e-commerce application, the website stores this information in a database or persistent storage system to ensure that your shopping experience is seamless and personalized. 
It relies on maintaining and accessing the stored data to provide you with relevant information and carry out actions based on your session's state.

# Stateless E-commerce Application:

Now, let us consider a stateless e-commerce application. In this case, the website treats each request or action independently without maintaining any session-specific state. 

Here is how it would work:
Each time you add items to your shopping cart, the website doesn't remember the cart contents unless you explicitly provide the necessary information in subsequent requests.
If you navigate to different pages or close the browser and reopen it, the website will not retain any information about your previous session.
When you proceed to the checkout process, you need to provide all the required information, including shipping address and payment details, in each step of the process.
In a stateless e-commerce application, the website does not rely on maintaining session state. 
It treats each request independently, typically through passing all necessary information in the request itself. 
The application does not store any user-specific data between requests and doesn't rely on previously stored data.
